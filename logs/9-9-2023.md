I found out yesterday or the day before that the multithreading of the data generation kind of does nothing T-T.

Probably because scipy ode solver is already multithreaded or something ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Also I've been working for some time on getting the method of lines algorithm to properly solve the KdV equation, but it doesn't seem to work :/

At least, the Fisher equation solves properly.
